					<h2>American Tribal Style&#174 Bellydance</h2>
				<p>
					ATS&#174 short for <a href="https://fcbd.com/about/about-ats/">American Tribal Style&#174</a>, was created in the 1990s' by
					Carolena Nericcio-Bohlman director of FatChanceBellydance&#174
					the style combines different influences such as Indian dance, Egyptian bellydance or Flamenco, the format is based on group improvisation using a vocabulary of steps.
					The feeling is at the same time elegant, wild and extremely empowering. It's all about being part of 'the tribe' and being stonger and happier together.
					From ATS&#174 evolved newer forms of dance such as Tribal Fusion bellydance or ITS.
					<a href="https://fcbd.com/about/about-ats/">What is ATS&#174?</a>
				</p>
				<h2>How can I enroll?</h2>
				<p>
					Contact me via <a href="mailto:isa.bidou@gmail.com?subject=class enquiry"class="toplinks">email</a> or phone on <a href="tel:+353851355940">0851355940</a>
				</p>

				<h2>What to expect from the beginners ATS&#174 Classes?</h2>
				<p>
					After the 6 first classes you will have gained basic knowledge about the ATS&#174 bellydance format.
					You will have drilled the basics in terms of steps, zil patterns, formations and practiced improvisation.
					Each class will introduce new steps and a new focus.
					The first round of class is thought as a solid introduction to the format.
					You should repeat it and work on your skills at least until you feel comfortable and ready to start working on a more advanced level.
					Even advanced dancers need to drill basic steps on a regular basis, so it is a good idea to keep working on level one even after you have started working on a more advanced level.

				</p>

				<h2>Class structure</h2>
				<p>
					Classes typically start with a short warm up and conditioning section inspired by yoga, pilates and general fitness.
					We then break down new steps and introduce new topics. We drill. We finish with a short cool down/meditation section.
				</p>
				<h2>Fitness level required</h2>
				<p>
					Bellydance is a low-impact activity that is not hard on the joints and is suitable for people with varying levels of fitness.
					It's going to be very good for you if you have not had a physical activity in a while and no special fitness level is required to attend class.
				</p>

				<h2>What do I need to bring/wear?</h2>
				<p>
					Something comfortable.. leggings... yoga pants... a hip scarf if you have it. You can dance bare feet.. with socks or dance shoes.
					You can bring a yoga mat if you have one for the conditioning and cool down sections.
					The only thing you will need to get is zils.
				</p>

				<h2>You will need zils</h2>
				<p>
					I got my zils from Shaila.de I was advised to choose saroyan zils, I picked a set that is medium size (I tried bigger and it was not comfortable for my small hands) and medium price called nefertiti (35 euros) and am very happy with them. There are very affordable options on eBay but I have not tried them.
				</p>

				<ul>

					<li>
						<a href="http://www.shaila.de/en/props/cymbals/saroyan/"target="_blank">saroyan zills</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="http://www.shaila.de/en/saroyan-nefertiti.html"target="_blank">saroyan nefertiti (mine)</a>
					</li>

				</ul>

				<p>

					<br />
					I recommend that you get a decent pair of zills because you won&#8217t have to buy them everyday and your set could last a life time and they are nice objects anyway.
					the sooner you get them the sooner they will be familiar the sooner you will get comfortable with them.
					<br />
					Zils are used to accompany fast steps in ATS&#174 and they are also used in other styles of bellydance like Tribal Fusion ;  being comfortable playing them is a good idea if you are serious about bellydance.

				<h1>Isabelle Bidou's Conditioning classes for Dancers</h1>
				
				
				
				<p>
				This class's primary aim is to support dancers in the fitness aspect of their practice. 
				Endevour at correcting frequent muscle imbalances specific to Tribal bellydance and contemporary urban lifestyle.
				It is aimed at Tribal dancers but could be recommended for dancers from any dance style.
				I will be using Ashley Lopez Integrated dance format.
				
				The class will be low impact, focus will be on strengh, balance and flexibility. 
				</p>
				
				<h2>What to expect from Conditioning for Dancers Classes?</h2>
				<p>
				
				We will use a combination of yoga asanas, pilates exercices and general fitness practice.
			
				We will train the left side of the body since this side does not get the same level of TLC as the right side in ATS&#174 and to a lesser extent in Tribal Fusion. 
				We will work on our shimmies, on engaging our lower abs for bellyrolls, on our splits, everything dancers say they will get to but never do.
			 	Classes take place on Sundays at the <a id="locationlink"onclick="showLocation();">Olympic Karate Club</a> in Shandon Street at 5:00pm.
					
			 	Price: 6 classes for 45 euros or 10 euros per class (discounts available if you sign up for the dance and the conditioning classes)

				</p>
				<h2>What do I need to bring/wear?</h2>
				
				
				<p>
					
					It is strongly advised that you bring a yoga mat and if you have them yoga blocks and stretch bands.
					You can wear anything comfortable like leggings, yoga pants...
					You can use socks or dance shoes or be bare footed.
